#### Globally, at least 2.2 billion people have a near or distance vision impairment. In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.This 1 billion people includes those with moderate or severe distance vision impairment or blindness.  
From reading a newspaper or a book or preparing for exam to reading an important text message from your bank, it is tough for them to read the text written in it.A similar problem they also face is beauty of pictures and images surrounding to us . Today, in the world of social media, millions of images are uploaded daily. Some of them are about your friends and family, while some of them are about nature & its beauty. Understanding what is present in that image is quite challenging for certain people who are suffering from visual impairment or who are blind.  
In an initiative to help them experience the beauty of the images, Facebook had earlier launched a unique feature earlier that can help blind people operate the app on their mobile phones. The feature could explain the contents of an image that their friends have posted on Facebook. So, say, if someone posted a picture with their dog in the park, the application would speak out the contents and may describe it like, “This image may contain a dog standing with a man around the trees.”  

In this project, we will convert an image to text description first; then, using a simple text-to-speech API, we will extract the text description/caption and convert it to audio. So the central part is focused on building the caption/text description whereas the second part, which is transforming the text to speech is relatively easy with the text to speech API.
